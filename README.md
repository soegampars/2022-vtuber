# Project Repository: Analysis of Indonesian Virtual YouTubers Viewership

by Immanuel Satya Pekerti

The repository keeps the data and programming scripts used throughout the project.
Anyone who wish to extend or simply replicate the analysis may use the data provided in this repository.

## Notes on the data cleaning
1. Author found videos with disabled view count and unclear/unavailable date, and decided to omit such observations.
2. YouTube shorts (less than 60 seconds) are removed due to the different nature of stream videos.
3. Videos before debut are removed.
4. Debut videos are treated as control variable due to special nature of the video (attracting unusual amount of viewers).
