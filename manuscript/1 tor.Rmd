## Background and Previous Studies

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipiscing elit.

## Research Objective

The study aims to understand better the determinants of Indonesian Virtual YouTubers viewership.
Limited to this particular scope since the relatively homogenous content-creating patterns (e.g., content type, interaction patterns, etc.).

## Research Questions

1. What are the factors affecting view count of a certain virtual YouTuber?
    - Gender
    - Content types
    - Duration since debut
    - Language ability (declared)
    - Regional characteristics (accent)
    - 3D model availability
  
2. Whether gender of the talent affect the growth of viewership?
3. Whether certain combination of talent and content boost viewership?
4. Whether the growth of viewers follows a certain pattern across time after controlling for idiosyncratic characteristics?

## Urgency and Importance

I don't really know. This is just for fun, after all.

## Data and Methodology

Data regarding the YouTube video metadata is retrieved from https://mattw.io/youtube-metadata/bulk by Matthew Wright.

Analysis will be conducted using fixed-effect panel data analysis.

Fixed effect control: Agency and personality
