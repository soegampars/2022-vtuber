## Abstract

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipiscing elit.

## Introduction
<!-- Research objective -->
The study aims to better understand the determinants of Indonesian Virtual YouTubers viewership.
<!-- Research questions -->
Author has set out four research questions to guide the direction of our investigation.
First, this study asks what are the factors affect the viewership of a virtual YouTuber talent.
Second, author also wants to know whether the gender of the talent affects the viewership growth.
Third, whether certain combination of talent and content type help boost viewership growth.
Fourth, whether the viewership growth follows a certain pattern across time.

- Does being in an agency helps boost viewership?
- Does longer video duration bring more viewers?
- Has the VTuber industry reached its peak? Has the market been saturated?
If not, then why are there numerous talents who retire early? (What is the measure of 'early'?)
- How is the growth of viewership (demand proxy) of such contents? Does it have quadratic, linear, or exponential pattern?
- What is the concentration of demand (in person hours) among the talents? Deriving from this, what is the state of the competition among talents and agencies?
- How does the independent talents fare against the circles/agencies? How do they stay in the fight, or even flourish in the face of such competition?
